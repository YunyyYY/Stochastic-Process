# Recurrent States Problem

**Theorem 1**: If *C* is a finite, closed and irreducible set, then all states in *C* are recurrent.

If *C* is infinite, is it possible tha all states in *C* are recurrent?

**Theorem 2** If a state *x* is recurrent, and <img src="http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl= x\rightarrow y " style="border:none;"> in finite steps, then *y* is finite.
