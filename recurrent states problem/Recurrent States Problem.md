## Recurrent States Problem

**Theorem 1**: If $C$ is a finite, closed and irreducible set, then all states in C are recurrent.

If $C$ is infinite, is it possible tha all states in $Câ€‹$ are recurrent?

**Theorem 2** If a state $x$ is recurrent, and $x\rightarrow y$ in finite steps, then $y$ is finite.
